17 Aug - Started laying out index page, selected photos to use. My plan is
    to create a multi-page site. My home page will be an array of tiles
    with photo backgrounds and some sort of dynamic reaction when moused over
    that link to the other pages. 

19 Aug - have a basic idea what the index page will look like. Implemented 
    start of previous experience page. Wrote javascript code to place
    experiences on the page.
