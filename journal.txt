Final project progress journal
Michael Han

17 Aug - Started laying out index page, selected photos to use. My plan is
    to create a multi-page site. My home page will be an array of tiles
    with photo backgrounds and some sort of dynamic reaction when moused over
    that link to the other pages. 

19 Aug - have a basic idea what the index page will look like. Implemented 
    start of previous experience page. Wrote javascript code to place
    experiences on the page. Created navbar javascript file to add navbar
    to top of each page

23 Aug - timeline for previous work section looks good, need to add a variant 
    for small screens. About section has been mostly fleshed out. Projects and
    contact pages exist but are stubs. TODO: find a better favicon for the
    page, make timeline work on mobile, decide a format for the contact page,
    and a format for the projects page.

24 Aug - Created contact form

25 Aug - Created grid layout for projects, used media queries to set number of
    columns. Added three projects, thinking of more to add. Minor tweaks to css
    in various places, made index cards a seperate class so they could be 
    different to the projects cards.
